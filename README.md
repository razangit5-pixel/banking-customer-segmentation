# Enhancing Banking Services with Customer Segmentation and Classification
# Collaborated on the CIS graduation project focusing on model development and deployment.

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance banking services by analyzing customer data and providing actionable insights through segmentation and classification.

### Key Contributions
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applied K-Means clustering to group customers based on banking behavior and demographics.  
- **Customer Classification:** Built a Logistic Regression model to classify customers for targeted banking strategies.  
- **Model Deployment:** Developed a Flask API to serve the models and integrated with a Flutter application for user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning:** K-Means Clustering, Logistic Regression  
- **Backend:** Flask API  
- **Frontend:** Flutter  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

## Outcome
- Automated customer segmentation for better banking decision-making.  
- Real-time customer classification accessible via the Flutter app.  
- Seamless deployment of ML model to production.
